### What is Mulebot?

Mulebot application covers the storage operational support of Kubernetes clusters. DevOps developers and administrators receive alerts, analytics of their OpenEBS volumes deployed across multi-cloud Kubernetes clusters into their [slack](https://slack.com/) channels, and also provides a way to query any configuration and status from Slack. The Muletbot functionality also includes interacting with DevOps developers and administrators to manage the yaml configurations files in their CI/CD system. The Mulebot enhances your experience with MayaOnline by allowing you to query the MayaOnline clusters'  configuration. Mulebot also keeps you informed about the current status of clusters that you have imported in MayaOnline by sending alerts whenever required. Once you integrate Slack, you will receive alerts related to the clusters imported in mayaonline to particular Slack Channel.
