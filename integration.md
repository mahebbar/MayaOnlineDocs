## ChatOps \(Mulebot?\) Integration

Integrating ChatOps enables interaction between clusters present in the organization on [MayaOnline](https://mayaonline.io/) and you through Slack. You will be able to receive alerts and query applications present in MayaOnline.

### What is Mulebot?

Mulebot application covers the storage operational support of Kubernetes clusters. DevOps developers and administrators receive alerts, analytics of their OpenEBS volumes deployed across multi-cloud Kubernetes clusters into their [Slack](https://slack.com/) channels, and also provides a way to query any configuration and status from Slack. The Muletbot functionality also includes interacting with DevOps developers and administrators to manage the yaml configurations files in their CI/CD system. The Mulebot enhances your experience with MayaOnline by allowing you to query the MayaOnline clusters' configuration and MayaOnline applications using the following slash commands.

**&lt;&lt;to add all commands or only maya help??&gt;&gt;**

* **/maya get clusters**
  * Lists all the clusters imported in MayaOnline whether active or inactive.
* **/maya get cluster cluster-name/cluster-Id**
  * Fetches all details of that particular cluster whose cluster-name or cluster-Id is provided.
* **/maya help**

Mulebot also keeps you informed about the current status of clusters that you have imported in MayaOnline by sending alerts as required.
