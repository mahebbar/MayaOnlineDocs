## ChatOps Integration

Integrating ChatOps enables interaction between clusters present in the organization on [MayaOnline](https://mayaonline.io/) and you through Slack. You will be able to receive alerts and query applications present in MayaOnline through slash commands.

### What is Mulebot?

Mulebot application covers the storage operational support of Kubernetes clusters. DevOps developers and administrators receive alerts, analytics of their OpenEBS volumes deployed across multi-cloud Kubernetes clusters into their [slack](https://slack.com/) channels, and also provides a way to query any configuration and status from Slack. The Muletbot functionality also includes interacting with DevOps developers and administrators to manage the yaml configurations files in their CI/CD system. The Mulebot enhances your experience with MayaOnline by allowing you to query the MayaOnline clusters'  configuration. Mulebot also keeps you informed about the current status of clusters that you have imported in MayaOnline by sending alerts as required. Once you integrate Slack, you will receive alerts related to the clusters imported in MayaOnline to the specified Slack channel. Following are the various types of alerts that you will receive.

* Cluster Up 
* Cluster Down  
* Volume Up  
* Volume Down  
* Volume Write Latency   
* Volume Read Latency  
* High CPU Usage
* High Disk Usage and so on.
