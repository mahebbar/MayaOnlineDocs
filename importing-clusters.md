# Managing Clusters

Managing clusters in MayaOnline is simple and easy to use. By default, when you login, the **Clusters **page is displayed. You can add a cluster to import, edit a cluster, and delete a cluster using the following procedures.

When you have not imported any clusters, you will have an option to import your very first cluster.

Click **Import a cluster now ** or view a demo by clicking on the **Watch how to import your first cluster **on the right pane.

1. Click on the **+** sign to add a cluster.  
2. You can either **Import an existing OpenEBS cluster** or **Install OpenEBS on your K8s cluster and import. **Click on either of these options.
