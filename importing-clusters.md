# Managing Clusters

Managing clusters in MayaOnline is simple and easy to use. By default, when you login, the **Clusters **page is displayed. You can add a cluster to import, edit a cluster, and delete a cluster using the following procedures.

When you have not imported any clusters, you will have an option to import your very first cluster.

Click **Import a cluster now ** or view a demo by clicking on the **Watch how to import your first cluster **on the right pane.

## Adding and Importing Clusters

You must add a cluster and import them to so that you can monitor

1. Click on the **+** sign to add a cluster.  
2. You can either **Import an existing OpenEBS cluster** or **Install OpenEBS on your K8s cluster and import. **Click on either of these options.
3. A kubectl command is displayed. Click **Copy **to copy the command and run it at your command prompt.
4. Close the window.
5. Paste the command at the Terminal \(which has access to the cluster\) and press **Enter **to run the command.
6. You will be automatically be redirected to the **Clusters **page where you can see the cluster details such as the OpenEBS applications, host details, and clicking **Kubernetes Dashboard** displays the Kubernetes dashboard associated with that cluster.
